# Summary

This is a socket mount for the Amazon Echo Dot, 3rd Gen, based on leefla's design.The mesh is completely new, but the measurements are built off of all the hard ground work that leefla already did. There's no way I could have made this without that design as a starting point.

I added some opening on various parts to access the cord, loosened the power-box socket, and changed how the tabs hold the dot in place.

I also removed the lid portion in favor of just printing with supports.

# Post-Printing

There might be the need to sand the inner ring socket a bit if your print warps as the fit is very snug.

There's a very thin bridge on the power box socket that helps the print keep stable without a raft. Just snip this out when finished printing.

## Power Cord:

Fitting the cord can be very finicky. If I were to make another iteration, it would be to add some sort of catch to keep it from popping out. Be prepared to spend some time trying to cram all 6ft of the power cable in the compartment.
