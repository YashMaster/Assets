# Summary

I needed a place to store my belts out of the way and use as little space as possible. Use whatever mounting method you like for anchoring to the wall; I used Wall-Dog screws.

The first belt holder slot is for dress belts. If you have the capability, it would be easy to remix this design based on personal needs.

Rev 1 is the design that in the picture. Rev 2 I adjusted the position of the feature that holds the belt up downward by 0.75 inch. This should achieve two things, reducing the chance of belt buckets snagging on each other and reducing the chance of the belt jamming on the hanger when putting belts away.

Notes: 
The dovetail fit perfectly without clean-up. I sanded between the slots somewhat just to break down the random threads of material.
