# Summary

I have quite a few ties and limited space in my wardrobe. I decided to make my own hanger as I couldn't find any that held a decent amount of ties and had open ends - which I find make it easier to insert/remove, particularly if you prefer to have both ends of the tie on the same side.


28/08/2017 - I updated both models. I reduced how far the hook curves round making it easier to place and take off the clothes rail. Secondly, I made the "end stops" taller making it harder for the ties to slip off when the rack is being moved around.
