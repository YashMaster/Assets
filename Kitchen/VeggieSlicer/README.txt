# Summary

<h3>My Version of the Veggie Slicing Bowl</h3>
I kept seeing this Veggie Slicing Bowl video come across my social media feeds and I thought to myself, “I can print that”. So I set out to create a version that I could print on my MP Mini.

This cool little device provides guides so you can cut your vegies in nice even slices. Then, turn the guides 90 degrees and you can Julian or even dice your vegies.

The assembly is made up of two pieces:
. 
<strong>The Dome/Bowl</strong>
This was a little tricky – however I was able to print this with pretty good result without supports. 
•	Layer Thickness: .175
•	Top layers: 4
•	Bottom Layers: 4
•	Outline Perimeters: 2
•	Outline Direction: Inside-out
•	Infill Percentage/Pattern: 30%/Grid (With solid diaphragms ever 20 layers)

<strong>The Base</strong>
This is a basic shape and just about any default settings your printer should do it.
This is a work in progress and I would love some feedback

<I>NOTE: The files that are posted are an update version from the photos of the last print I made. I’ll update those once I have the new version printed</I>
</br>

<strong>EDIT 2/1/17:</strong> Found minor issue wit the dome/bowl. Re-posted the STL

# How I Designed This

![Alt text](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/5c/d9/1e/c3/e0/Build_Image.jpg)
I used Cinima4D to create the geometry and Simplyfy3D to slice and print it.
